# BasePHP Framework

> **Note:** This repository contains the core code of the BasePHP framework. If you would like to use the framework for your application or want to see an example, visit [BasePHP Application](https://github.com/basephp/basephp).

BasePHP is a PHP framework for modern minimalist, who like *simplicity* and *speed*. BasePHP was built from the ground up, incorporating the best aspects from popular frameworks, and only including what is necessary and essential to building modern applications. You can extend BasePHP by developing or installing community packages.

A minimalist design is intended to keep your package lean and it's operations to only what you use; ultimately reducing waste and increasing load times.

To use BasePHP for your next application, check our the [Blank Application](https://github.com/basephp/basephp).
